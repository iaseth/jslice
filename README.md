# jslice
[`jslice`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jslice) is a small `JavaScript/TypeScript` library for handling colonArgs.

I felt the need for `jslice` when I was working on [`iaseth/josn`](https://github.com/iaseth/josn).

I am using [`readmix`](https://github.com/iaseth/readmix) for generating this README.
You can view the source file [here](https://github.com/iaseth/jslice/blob/master/README.md.rx).
